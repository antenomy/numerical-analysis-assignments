**Question:** How many roots are there?

**Answer:** There are 6. They are:
-  $x_1 ≈ 1.81$
- $x_2 ≈ 2.17$
- $x_3 ≈ 3.44$
- $x_4 ≈ 4.08$
- $x_5 ≈ 5.27$
- $x_6 ≈ 5.77$


#### Part b)

**Question:** Why can this new equation be used as a fix point iteration for the previous one?

**Answer:** Because the new function is the previous function rewritten as $g(x) = x$. This was done by:
1. Adding $20x$ to each side
2. Dividing both sides by $20$


**Question:** Which of these roots can fixed-point iteration find?

**Answer:** The convergence rate for this method is equal to $|g'(r)|$ and is locally convergent for $|g'(r)| < 1$. Thus the algorithm found the three roots which fulfil this and for the three roots which didn't, the starting point led the algorithm to the nearest root which was
convergent. This can be confirmed by examining the derivatives at the starting points:
- $x_1 \rightarrow -0.08$
- $x_2 \rightarrow 1.99$
- $x_3 \rightarrow -0.64$
- $x_4 \rightarrow 2.60$
- $x_5 \rightarrow -0.32$
- $x_6 \rightarrow  2.40$
Which correlates with the theorems assertion.
